## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to be able to interact with real crime statistics in a quick and engaging way.

Before playing the game, I want to know how to interact with this app.

I want to be able to save my scores and compare my results with others on the same machine.

I want to see who created this game, and have access to more of their work!

I want to have the website to be responsive so I can still interact with all the features on a mobile viewport.

## Future developments

There were many things we wanted to add but simply didnâ€™t have the time to implement.

- Improve gameplay by adding an area radius to the units so they solve crimes in an area
- Add upgrades for units so you have ways of spending collected cash
- Add a functioning global highscores
- Add other map areas, so you can use your local area when you are playing the game
- Create a share button where you can share your scores on different social media platforms.
- Add onClick function to cards so that they flip on click then hover
- Add a pause and play button to demonstration video so that users can gain more understanding.
