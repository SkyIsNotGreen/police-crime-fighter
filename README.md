## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to be able to interact with real crime statistics in a quick and engaging way.

Before playing the game, I want to know how to interact with this app.

I want to be able to save my scores and compare my results with others on the same machine.

I want to see who created this game, and have access to more of their work!

I want to have the website to be responsive so I can still interact with all the features on a mobile viewport.

1. When a user clicks `Click to Start` on the _index.html_, LS is initiated. If there is a value of keys then on how to play tutorial is generated. If no, then the _user-input.html_ is generated.
2. On the how-to-play tutorial the donot show input stores value in LS.
3. On user-input pg username is stored in LS and game page is rendered and a key of resources object stored in LS.
4. In game when `marker is clicked ` an info banner appears.
5. When a `resource is clicked` the value in LS and the resource container is updated.
6. After the timer reaches the specified value LS/ resource container and money are updated.
7. When 25 markers are displayed(progress bar is 100%) game over modal is rendered.
8. The game over stops any more markers from being populated.
9. The values including username is stored in a key known as gameStats in LS.
10. The gameStats are stored in a key known as previousUserHistory that contains gameStats of previous games.
11. `On click of view scores` the _scores.html_ is initiated. (The scores page is also initated when quit is clicked on games-page)
12. `On load` the scores are read from local storage and sorted based on the money. The top 3 games will load on podium while the rest would load on separate leaderboard.

## Future developments

There were many things we wanted to add but simply didnâ€™t have the time to implement.

- Improve gameplay by adding an area radius to the units so they solve crimes in an area
- Add upgrades for units so you have ways of spending collected cash
- Add a functioning global highscores
- Add other map areas, so you can use your local area when you are playing the game
- Create a share button where you can share your scores on different social media platforms.
- Add onClick function to cards so that they flip on click then hover
- Add a pause and play button to demonstration video so that users can gain more understanding.
