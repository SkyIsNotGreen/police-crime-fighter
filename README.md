- Improve gameplay by adding an area radius to the units so they solve crimes in an area
- Add upgrades for units so you have ways of spending collected cash
- Add a functioning global highscores
- Add other map areas, so you can use your local area when you are playing the game
- Create a share button where you can share your scores on different social media platforms.
- Add onClick function to cards so that they flip on click then hover
- Add a pause and play button to demonstration video so that users can gain more understanding.
